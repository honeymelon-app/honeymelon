# E2E Testing for Honeymelon

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Honeymelon application using Playwright.

## Overview

The E2E tests verify the complete application workflow from the user's perspective, including:

- App launch and initialization
- File handling and drag-and-drop
- Preset selection and configuration
- Complete conversion pipeline (probe → plan → execute)
- Settings and preferences management
- Job queue operations and state management
- License activation and validation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Internationalization (i18n) and localization

## Running Tests

> **Note:** The Playwright suite targets the macOS Tauri bundle. Run the tests on macOS hardware with Xcode command line tools installed.

### Prerequisites

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. Ensure Tauri dev dependencies are present. The suite spawns `npm run tauri dev` automatically—no manual build step is required.

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
playwright test e2e/tests/app-launch.spec.ts
playwright test e2e/tests/settings.spec.ts
```

### Debug Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Helper Utilities

The fixtures and helpers under `e2e/helpers` provide a high-level API for orchestrating the desktop app:

- `initialAppData` fixture option seeds `settings.json`, `jobs.json`, and `license.json` in the Tauri config directory prior to launch.
- `setAppData`, `seedPreferences`, `seedJobs`, `seedLicense` can be used directly from tests for ad-hoc state shaping.
- `mockTauriCommands(page, map)` overrides `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` for targeted commands. Pair with `mockCommandError(message, code)` to simulate rejection cases.
- `simulateFileDrop(page, selector, [paths])` dispatches synthetic drag events with actual files generated by `global-setup`.
- The helpers connect to the WebKit WebView via CDP using `--remote-debugging-port`. A dedicated Chromium instance is created per test to avoid stale sessions.

During E2E runs the app bootstraps with `VITE_E2E_SIMULATION=true`, which enables the simulated runner/probe logic and exposes `window.__HONEYMELON_TEST_API__` for fine-grained job control.

## Writing Tests

### Test Structure

Each test file follows this pattern:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive test names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
2. **One assertion per test**: Keep tests focused on a single behavior
3. **Clean up resources**: Use `afterAll` hooks to clean up spawned processes
4. **Handle timeouts**: Tauri app launch can be slow, adjust timeouts accordingly
5. **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on previous test state

### Connecting to Tauri WebView

The current test implementation uses placeholder tests. To connect to the actual Tauri WebView:

1. Launch the Tauri app in development mode
2. Enable remote debugging in the WebView
3. Connect Playwright to the debug port
4. Interact with the UI using Playwright selectors

Example (to be implemented):

```typescript
test('should launch app', async ({ page }) => {
  // Launch Tauri app
  const tauriProcess = spawnTauriDev();

  // Wait for WebView debug port
  await waitForDebugPort(9222);

  // Connect Playwright
  await page.goto('http://localhost:9222');

  // Test UI
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="app-title"]')).toBeVisible();

  // Cleanup
  tauriProcess.kill();
});
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage of all major features:

### App Launch and Initialization ([app-launch.spec.ts](tests/app-launch.spec.ts))

- Bootstrap sanity, primary window visibility, and chrome controls
- Drop-zone smoke test to ensure enqueued jobs render

### Preset Selection ([preset-selection.spec.ts](tests/preset-selection.spec.ts))

- Displays preset dropdowns for queued jobs
- Updates preset labels when users pick different formats
- Ensures audio jobs only list audio presets

### Conversion Flow ([conversion-flow.spec.ts](tests/conversion-flow.spec.ts))

- Happy-path conversion (queued → running → completed)
- Cancellation during running state
- Progress indicator visibility while running
- Manual failure injection to verify error messaging
- Batch queue validation

### Settings Controls ([settings.spec.ts](tests/settings.spec.ts))

- Destination chooser dialog interactions
- Custom output folder selection via mocked backend command
- Theme toggle behavior

### Job Queue Operations ([job-queue.spec.ts](tests/job-queue.spec.ts))

- Adds/removes jobs and clears completed entries
- Tab-based filtering between video/audio queues
- Start All execution path

### License Management ([license.spec.ts](tests/license.spec.ts))

- First-run activation dialog
- Activation success/failure flows via mocked `activate_license`
- Bypass when a stored license exists

### Internationalization ([i18n.spec.ts](tests/i18n.spec.ts))

- Language switcher updates tab labels
- Locale preference persists after reload through localStorage

### Error Handling ([error-handling.spec.ts](tests/error-handling.spec.ts))

- General failure banners on jobs
- Permission-specific guidance (Full Disk Access CTA)

## Future Coverage Ideas

- Simulate desktop-bridge file drop events from the Rust side to exercise drag-and-drop plumbing without relying on DOM events.
- Add resilience specs that kill the Tauri process mid-conversion and verify queue recovery on relaunch.
- Mirror Playwright flows with Vitest suites that hit the bridge composables (`useJobOrchestrator`, `useDesktopBridge`) to keep frontend-backend contracts tight.

- License activation dialog
- Valid/invalid license key handling
- Network error handling during activation
- Trial mode activation and countdown
- Trial expiration warnings
- License status display
- License validation and revalidation
- Multi-device activation management
- Feature gating based on license status
- License recovery and import/export

### Error Handling ([error-handling.spec.ts](tests/error-handling.spec.ts))

- Invalid file handling (non-media, corrupted, missing, permission errors)
- FFmpeg errors (not found, crash, invalid arguments, missing encoders)
- Disk space errors (insufficient space, disk full, unavailable directories)
- Network errors (capability detection, license validation)
- System resource errors (memory, permissions, CPU/GPU overload)
- Conversion-specific errors (audio-only files, unusual durations/aspect ratios, multiple streams)
- Error recovery and retry functionality
- App stability and crash resilience

### Internationalization ([i18n.spec.ts](tests/i18n.spec.ts))

- Language selection and switching
- Language persistence
- System language detection
- Translation coverage (UI elements, settings, job statuses, errors, presets, dialogs)
- Supported languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, etc.)
- Right-to-left (RTL) support (Arabic, Hebrew)
- Fallback and missing translation handling
- Pluralization and interpolation
- Layout adaptation for different text lengths
- Font rendering for different scripts
- Accessibility label translation

## Helper Utilities

## Current Implementation Status

The E2E tests are currently set up with:

- ✅ Playwright configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive test file structure (8 test files)
- ✅ Test scaffolding with detailed placeholder tests (200+ test cases)
- ✅ Helper utilities for Tauri app control
- ✅ Media fixture generation with FFmpeg
- ⏳ Tauri WebView connection (helper functions ready, needs Tauri config)
- ⏳ Actual UI interaction tests (scaffolding complete, needs implementation)

The placeholder tests verify that the test infrastructure works correctly and provide a complete blueprint for implementation. To fully implement E2E testing:

1. Configure Tauri to expose a debug port for the WebView
2. Use the helper functions to connect Playwright to the Tauri WebView
3. Replace placeholder test bodies with actual UI interactions using the provided test structure
4. Generate test media files using the media fixture helpers

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail to launch the app

- Ensure the app is built: `npm run tauri:build`
- Check that FFmpeg is installed and accessible
- Verify macOS security settings allow the app to run

### WebView connection fails

- Check that the debug port is not already in use
- Verify the Tauri app is configured to enable remote debugging
- Ensure firewall settings allow localhost connections

### Tests are flaky

- Increase timeout values in `playwright.config.ts`
- Add explicit waits for elements to be visible
- Ensure test isolation by cleaning up state between tests
